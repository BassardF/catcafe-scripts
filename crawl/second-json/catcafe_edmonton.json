When we went today there was only one person working so she seemed a bit stressed out having to manage the drinks and watch the people coming in as well. A second employee came soon after to help though. The top portion of the cat room is supposed to be ages 7 and up, though there were tons of very young children up there presumably because the parents wanted to sit on the comfortable furniture. All in all a great place!","time":1519078085},{"author_name":"Lisa Bourgeault","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116359256885524675824/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C_YL3FFHpz4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKWU/-HrjXrKx-wo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Loved this place! Itâ€™s a good system where you can go into a separate room and order your food/drinks and then just by paying a little extra can bring them into the large space to be with a variety of cats! The cats just roam around and some do want to play but mostly they just want to get pet and keep to themselves. The space is quite big so allows more privacy and for you to be able to have your own space. Itâ€™s a cool space thatâ€™s worth checking out!","time":1519361418},{"author_name":"Kenino Space","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100714598552362076690/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ih4AihAT4Ag/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA5g/cusDdCOoC_k/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Nice place. All the cats are up for adoption unless already adopted. Most of the cats are around 6 months old when I went. They cats are cute and for the price it was itâ€™s not bad. \n\n$15 for unlimited drinks for an hour and admission. 1 dollar extra for dry treats. 2 extra for wet treats. The cats are cats and sometimes theyâ€™ll be sleeping or they wonâ€™t be very active but itâ€™s nice to be around them. \n\nThe only bad thing is that while they have a shoe rack people donâ€™t use it. Iâ€™m sorry but how am I supposed to get in. \n\nAlso while I do think children should be allowed I think theyâ€™re should be a limit or should be some supervision. I saw a cat get harassed by a 2 year old and the child wouldnâ€™t let it escape to the 7+ year old area. \n\nMinor gripe is minor (and mostly the parents fault).","time":1520735421},{"author_name":"Your ArtVentures","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113846809246136367034/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rae1WoUgRIA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/T54sPeYH4Zo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"I didn't realize that the cat cafe is a foster home/adoption centre for all these precious fur babies!
