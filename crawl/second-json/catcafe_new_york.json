Great place to come sit down if you have to get some work done and enjoy the vibes of the place and people it attracts. The barista there the night I went also was super friendly and talked to almost every person who bought something and the conversations I was hearing from the back even drew me in. Also the sandwiches and foods there looked reallly good, definitely will be trying one my next time around! There’s tons of seating in the back too \nTip: ask for a stamp card! Some places don’t give it out unless you ask, sadly didn’t, but wish I did so ask!\nAlso ask for the WiFi password

We called in advance and asked how busy they were beforehand which is always a good idea. We got there at 3:30 and the cats were being fed and getting a break until 4 so we got some lattes while we waited which were really good! Cats were really friendly and staff was too. Loved the fact that the cats have their own little closed off room in the back where they can get away from people if they want to 😂 All of them are up for adoption too which is wonderful","time":1512140241},{"author_name":"Kesavan Kushalnagar","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111608475111098078695/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BvTMa6b6IeQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABDY/B9MmQNQknf0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Great time! Definitely would go back. The cats are really cute, and there's a big selection of ways to interact with them. The staff are really fun to talk to as well, so make sure you ask them about the cats and stuff. Some of them are a bit grumpier than others so be a bit careful.","time":1515119895},{"author_name":"Amy Labombarda","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113007284023624056774/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lxes28FUvUs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAj7Y/0NdYSL2UzjQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"I was very excited about visiting this place after I saw an episode of “My cat from Hell”, and today, I must say it was really disappointing.
