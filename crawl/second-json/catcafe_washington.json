Approximately 8-12 cats roam the area enjoying the high perches, scratching posts, and hidey-holes. Most are friendly and will allow you to pet them. In fact, if you just sit down and relax, they will seek you out, especially if you are otherwise occupied, like reading a book. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nWhile there is a great relaxing vibe here, I do have to mention that it does smell like several cats live there. Those with extra sensitive noses should be prepared. After a few minutes of cat cuddles, the smell fades into the background.\n\n There is a $5 beverage charge as a cover fee and beverage choices include hot chocolate, coffee drinks, and tea. There were cold drink choices too. The beverages were fine, but nothing special. However, the drinks aren't really the point. Consider it a donation to a good cause.\n\nAll in all, this is a great way to get a \"cat fix\" and to relax.

I think it's a fun idea but it can be executed better. You have to pay to get a stamp to be let into a tiny room for 30 minutes of kitty time. The room is \"guarded\" by a \"cat bouncer\" and gets full of people who are awkwardly chasing after cats to play with (whether the cat wants to or not).\n\nFood: They don't always have menu items in stock and it's overpriced but they do have some interesting food. It's obvious their selling point is the cat room.\n\nCats: They have resident cats and adoptable cats but there is no information on the walls about these cats. Most cats just wanted to be left alone to sleep. The customers that we encountered did not want to leave the room until they were told to. The whole experience was pretty bizarre. I probably wouldn't go back again.\n\nIf you just want to be in a room full of cats, maybe try volunteering at a local animal shelter. They could probably use your help.","time":1520909032},{"author_name":"Courtney Leake","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114209841488495336589/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2azy90Vh70c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGi4gfx3KV3UjmbOIs7K4GaXOPUCbKF3SQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I’ve been yearning to visit Neko ever since they opened and finally went for the first time on this classically grey, foggy, drizzly Seattle Sunday morning. The cat room looked cozy with about 8 cats and 8-10 people sipping their coffee and hanging with the sweet kitties. I got a lovely house blend drip coffee to go but first sat and chatted with the friendly, enthusiastic and passionate staff. Mellow music played while we talked and it felt like a home away from home - clean and comfortable. Great atmosphere, delicious coffee, clever merchandise (I love my new mug! “Fur Real Tho”) and most importantly, a powerful mission, finding good homes for cats in need.

As for when the cats will choose you, pray to the cat overlords. Reservations are highly recommend to guaranteed your spot. Overall size of the café is small, but that gives it the cozy feeling.
