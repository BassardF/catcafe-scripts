While walk ins are accepted, spots are limited -  I heard people looking to walk in being told there were no spots for 4 hours.

Cats and cat lovers together in perfect harmony :) A quiet and calming environment for the cats and cat lovers alike. There were 8+ cats to get to know on the the day that we visited, all with different personalities. The staff were wonderful, very welcoming and provided information on each kitty. It was obvious that the staff memebers truly cared about each of the animals and were very knowledgeable. There are lots of cat-themed items to puchase including cat shaped desserts and macaroons, although I didnâ€™t try them, they looked delicious. (The latte art was amazing too) No pressure to adopt although if you wanted to, I canâ€™t think of a better place to start your search for a new pet. Word of warning, many of the cats have previously experienced traumatic times, this is not a place for unruly children. You can pet each cat but not pick them up or chase them (obviously). Very clean too, not smelly. Overall a fabulous experience.
