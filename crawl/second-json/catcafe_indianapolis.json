If you chose, you can pay $5 to hang out with the cats in the Cat Lounge for an hour.

There is a big viewing window for all to watch the cats play in the Lounge without fear of getting dirty and contaminating your food.

Or, if you're adventurous, step in and play with cats for an hour. The cats are up for adoption. The drinks are decent, but the facility leaves something to be desired. (It definitely smells like cat pee, which doesn't inspire sitting and sipping unless you are exceptionally fond of cats.) Still, it's a cute idea, and it seems to be a pretty popular place. It's worth a visit just for the experience.","time":1516560642},{"author_name":"Ashley Blake","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118187449871659215681/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mzNmYNcY6DA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABIA/39IDHPwmtZI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Updated review:\nI will admit that in my last review was a little over the top, and that was my fault and my fault only. I got a response from the company that was very nice and apologetic, and I found that to be a very mature and sweet way for them to tell me what really was happening. I now realize that the people who told us to come back were not employees, but were instead working with the comedy show that was going on. Since then, I have visited to thus warm and welcoming place with lots of cute cats! This is not a place to pass up, it is really something special.\n\nPrevious review: \nFamily was in town so we wanted to see if we could sit and relax with the cats and some drinks. I was very excited to go, saw the cats on the way up and it looked very nice. It was only when I went in that it earned one star. It was comedy night, and so the entrance was packed. We talked to an employee who was outside and she said that we could just ask to go into the cat room, there was just no place to sit. When we went inside, we had teens with us and an employee rushed to get us out because the show had cursing. We told her we just wanted to go into the cat room and if we can quick go in, but she said to come back in 10 minutes when the show was over. We came back 10 minutes later and she said 5 more minutes. Obviously you just didn't want my money, so we left. Sad that I wasn't able to go while family was in town.","time":1519516648},{"author_name":"Mookie Graves","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102713625742116026935/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bO4rmmJSE6c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAo/he2JnkKIIA8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"So, I'm in love.
