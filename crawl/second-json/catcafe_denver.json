I have enjoyed every visit I've taken there and constantly suggest it as a place to go and hang out with friends. The Denver Cat Company not only has lovely kitties, but lovely staff who are incredibly passionate about their job and are eager to answer any questions you have about the cats. I do not usually recommend the cafe for children, as it can be stressful for the cats to be around kids who are more active. It may be good to leave the little ones at home if you plan on visiting the cafe.","time":1518837141},{"author_name":"rollswetlogs","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102045382818494594644/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MWZtR21emUA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF8/uVB2PC6xjyc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Cute little cat cafe for feline fans.
