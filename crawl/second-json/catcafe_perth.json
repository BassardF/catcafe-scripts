Cats should sleep 18 hours per day, and it's torturous for them to be in such over-stimulating conditions (too much noise and touching, in contact with total strangers all the time). From my perception, I found the cats nervous, anxious - far from happy. I expected \"home-like\" conditions where the cats could freely walk around the cafe, without \"must-do\" entertaining. Mr. Fox was staring at me as if asking me to be his advocate. I saw how unwilling he was to leave the back room and enter the show room. No, no, no. I will never return or recommend it to anyone else. Give the cats up for adoption. Don't keep them in such conditions.","time":1511405458},{"author_name":"Ben Gill","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116385266878016980981/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-J_bSzWrMc7Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADM/8kNQjy8bjLM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I'm not a cat person - I've always had dogs as pets.
