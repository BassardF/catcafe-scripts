Secondly the cats are well groomed. Most of the cats are longhaired and each one of them had fluffy and smooth fur. What bewildered me a little bit is, that the staff put some of them in clothing..for a sphinx cat it might make sense (to keep it warm in the relatively chilly air) but one of them seemed to struggle a lot. We ordered two drinks, both were good. tho the ceylon tea was a bit too sweet for my taste (but i also forgot to tell them to reduce the sweetness). later on we ordered the banana crepe which was also delicious. for us good food in a pet cafe is a nice feature, especially if its reasonable priced.","time":1504188429}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=13219294751287101353","utc_offset":420,"vicinity":"Pattaya City, Bang Lamung District"},"status":"OK"}}]
