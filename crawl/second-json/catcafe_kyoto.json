These are all older rescue cats which was the reason I chose this place. However that means that they might be less playful then some of the \"name brand\" cat cafes in Tokyo. We came in and there were maybe 10 ish cats laying around. Two of them were in clothes which I did NOT like at first. But then the women who worked there brought out an information book in all the cats and that's when my heart broke. All rescue cats and the two who were wearing clothes have several allergies which means they will lick off all their fur. Poor babies. The cats got more excited when we bought treats for them- which was worth it for the extra affection. A couple of them sat on people's laps and they all like to have their butts patted hard- the workers showed us. This was a less playful time then I was expecting. But I am so glad I gave my money and time and affection to these cats.","time":1492386745},{"author_name":"David Scott","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106443634916750110472/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Sk0BudAf45s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGg/l_LGgaoVodQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"Interesting experience, cat cafe in Kyoto.

There was none of that here: the cats are content, relaxed, and clearly love the shop owner to pieces. They have places to retreat to and each cat's personality is respected. The owners make sure no cat is being touched or bothered against its will.\n\nI ended up spending nearly 3 hours here instead of the hour I planned on, and it was phenomenal.
