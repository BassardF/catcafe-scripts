I love that they are helping homeless kitties find homes. We actually came in the afternoon, and the cats were a bit tired (as to be expected), but they were so sweet.\n\nThey cars were very sociable and all had very distinctive personalities. Their living area/play area was so intricate, and looked well designed for all of them. And despite there being so many cats, I didn't really notice an official for their litter. Would definitely love to swing by again.","time":1520218649},{"author_name":"Nick Gardner","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114459659662605851656/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gjebcn7Ta0I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApg/z3A-6OavM5I/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Java Cats is one of my favorite places in Atlanta!

They're in a bright,  large space that is beautiful and comfortable. The owner is extremely passionate about her kitties and it shows. She gave us a tour and detailed her plans for the space to help with kitten intake.\n\nIt is $7 for all day which is an absolute steal.\n\nAs of right now they cannot offer food or beverage on the premises but directly across the street is a wonderful artisanal grocery store with a great coffee bar. Quick stop over there you get your coffee and you come over to pet the cats. I'm very excited to see this place only become more popular with time.","time":1515548037},{"author_name":"Lily Prince","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104414791660812545205/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ujn4EhqKvuw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGi4gfxCjxbDwEv4dfdTk8bw5fWsJhdv7Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"We stopped by Java Cats when visiting Atlanta without a reservation, and the room was full, but they told us we could wait a while and the next hour had some space.

It's totally well maintained and not dirty at all, for those who might would think so. \n\nSecondly, the cats are so nice. Obviously they can get grumpy, so it is possible for them to try and be mean, but for the most part they are all very nice and friendly! Also, the money you pay goes towards helping sheltered animals, and you can adopt any cat in the cafe, same day! \n\nOverall, with a great staff and great cats, I would totally recommend going!","time":1516569501}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["cafe","store","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=135643972715231779","utc_offset":-240,"vicinity":"415 Memorial Drive Southeast C, Atlanta","website":"http://javacatscafe.com/"},"status":"OK"}}]
