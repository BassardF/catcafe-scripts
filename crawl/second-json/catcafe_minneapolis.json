It functions as a foster home for cats and gets them adopted as well as socialize them. What I love about the cafe is that it’s designed for the cats. There’s not a lot of sitting area but that’s perfectly fine because the design of the room is for the comfort of the cats, not the pleasure of the humans. Overall the staff are super friendly and really helpful, and it’s obvious they love cats. I think the rules that they’ve set in place are for the cats safety and comfort. Obviously there’s a rule that you can’t pick up the cats- how are the staff supposed to know whether or not you know how to properly hold a cat? And it’s just kind of rude to wake a sleeping cat. Cats sleep like 16 hours a day, how would you like it if someone woke you up multiple times throughout the night when you slept? Also, I think $10 is perfectly reasonable. Obviously cats aren’t free to sustain; they need food (wet and dry, to get a balanced diet) and toys and cat litter and new scratching posts and all the necessities that it takes to own a cat. Plus, they have to pay rent on the building, which isn’t going to be cheap. I think the Cafe Meow is fantastic. Obviously if I could go see cats for free I would, but I’m a reasonable human being that understands that it costs money to take care of cats.","time":1520639206},{"author_name":"Amanda Quade","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101426083769676980416/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nYvKmrV-X_s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGi4gfz9L_AHs7Ka5YaE1uUbo6jyXIJ-Xg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"This place is a wonderland for the adoptable cats, about 15 cats in total. The cat space allows for the animals to crawl and sleep in all sorts of nooks and crannies, and for that I applaud them. The cat visitation area has plenty of windows so those not visiting can see the animals (great idea). The drink menu is fairly basic, with a small dessert case that I didn't partake in. I think it's a lovely idea overall, but the cats seemed exhausted by the perpetual stream of people. You can't bother them while sleeping, nor can you pick them up to snuggle. The visitation room is truly designed for the cats, so there is a limited amount of comfortable seating for the visitors- it was a challenge to get truly comfortable and enjoy the cat company.","time":1518913644},{"author_name":"Michael Schultz","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118234296636595007191/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-d1eLooQcyRc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAIX0/71E8H00uV3k/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"I really like this place.
