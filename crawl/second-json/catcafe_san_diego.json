But I'm very glad I tried again before the end of my trip since it was a great place to spend an hour or two. The admission price is great. The fact that you get admission from buying a drink is really an amazing deal. It is not a big cat area but not tiny either. I thought the amount of space and cats was perfect so that you could see most of them at once and not need to run back and forth to try and find the best spots to play. Yes, there is a chance cats aren't going to approach you a ton or seem super playful, but what do you expect? They are cats and people come all day long to pet them :) They can afford to nap all day and be picky about play time. This is pretty consistent with other cat cafes I have visited. So keep that in mind!","time":1519853117},{"author_name":"Jarrod Kailef","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326983728520949884/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AwPLfXFplkw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAOCs/TEvk0O-zrzY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"I really wanted to love this place, I really did! I guess I was a bit let down because I wanted there to be... I don't know. More cats? Friendlier cats? Really, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I left feeling a little bit let down. Maybe I just wish I had more time with the cats, you only get a half hour. That said, there was nothing wrong with this place. I definitely appreciate what they are doing, and I'm glad they are here. This place reinforced for me that much of the joy of cat ownership is learning about your cat(s) and befriending them over many years.","time":1519005895},{"author_name":"Mark Waite","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106067738196972976874/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eu0OLHUhFJc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACpQ/L2JxrJOQatQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"I thought it would cost us a larger sum to see the cats, but all you do is buy an item and it counts toward the whole cost.
