I got cider because I know I can't stand soy milk. Apparently they put some liquor flavor in it that just makes it taste like burnt sugar. My girlfriend ordered a coconut latte. It just tasted like burnt bitter soy milk. Now why does a place filled with cats need to be vegan? Cats are not vegan. Having vegan options is great, but there is middle ground. Keep it simple. Let cider just be cider. Have goats milk if you disapprove of cow dairy. Boom solved. Have thing that don't include dairy or soy. Honestly, I'm more afraid of soy processing than any animal product. I'm sure a cat would agree. Then there's the 5 dollar entry. Maybe that's because it's so close to a homeless area, but I'm never paying that again. Especially for having an awful menu. Service was fine, but policy is intrusive. I gave you all a fake e-mail though so fine by me. Good luck staying in business.","time":1517794135},{"author_name":"Gloria Quintero","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118435858984553608437/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4JtEoEFVo_s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGi4gfwrSz-mfv4Oz5vSs7JMOnuSiAzWZw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Really great coffee!  The cats are so adorable and friendly!  Staff was all friendly!  Our waitress Alexis was super friendly and attentive even though it was busy!!!\n\nUPDATE: I came back 2 more times with my kids. Worms in water bowls for cats. Another cat was sick and the waitresses were talking to each other about how they took the cat with their own money because the owner refused. They also bought special cat food with their own money because the cat couldn't eat the dry food. I also could hear the owner screaming at one of her employees from the back. Another waiter was outside taking on the phone as we left. He was upset because the owner hadn't paid him in weeks. I looked over at a worker by the food trailer and she just smiled and nodded her head to agree. Coffee is still good. Cats are still friendly. Waitresses still awesome. Owner is not OK!!!\n\n***Edit after owners response. I am 100% not a protester lol Don't assume because my name is Hispanic that I have some alternative agenda. My daughter was an employee at blue cat Cafe and this is what I witnessed when I visited. Don't want bad reviews?

This seems like something that could only exist in a place like Austin. I can tell that the staff really enjoys the cats and the cats love being there. Naturally, some cats are not very social and prefer to do their own thing. But there were several that came right up to us and allowed us to pet and play with them. The hot coffee was delicious and much appreciated on this cold day. The staff members were very nice and were very interactive with us. The setup inside is so perfect for cats. The cats have plenty of vertical space to explore and lots of toys to keep them entertained. I think this is a great idea and it was executed wonderfully.
