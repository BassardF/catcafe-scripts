pet cats.  \nDon't touch sleeping cats.\nDon't touch a cat's side.  \nDon't let cats lick you.\nDon't touch the Maine Coon, he doesn't like people.  \nDon't pet a cat for too long in one place - it's painful.  (I should tell my cats that; I don't think they know.)  \nDon't exhaust the cats; too many people is like harassment.\nThe kitty litter container have signs \"Don't open these doors\".\nA plastic container is labelled \"Don't open\".  (Wouldn't the word \"Private\" have accomplished the same thing?)\n\nI was afraid to move for fear of doing something wrong even though I  have 5 cats of my own.\n\nOne 4 year old child played with a 8 month old kitten using a toy the facility provided under the watchful eye of her Grandmother.  The kitten played and then fell asleep using the toy as a pillow.  One of the two supervising women who sat behind the desk,  not the slightest bit friendly, came storming over, removed the toy from under the kitten, hung it up and said, \"those are for big cats\".   The little girl, half confused and half hurt, looked at her Grandmother and said \"but the kitty was sleeping\".  She was right.  I thought we weren't supposed to disturb sleeping cats??  Her Grandmother looked at me as if to say \"Did that just happen?\"  My expression, in return said, \"Yup, it did ... and it's time to go\".  \n\nI LOVE CATS.  All I had wanted to do was enjoy a coffee surrounded by felines but this was downright unpleasant.   I exchanged glances with 2 other adults who were chaperoning children and it was apparent they were asking themselves the same questions.  So I put down my coffee and walked out.   The further away I got, the better I felt.  \n\nMy advice:\n\nDon't expect to convene with the cats too long; you can only stay an hour.   \nDon't go in with the hopes of finding a place of feline zen.\nIn fact ... don't bother.  Just don't do it.\nBut don't worry.  You can come to my house and love my cats because I don't use the word don't without good cause.","time":1520464157},{"author_name":"Rujuta Agate","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109006724079900030428/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5bwDTz-Ht8c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGi4gfxLCwIyfna25f14THQvsBYX6G9ZBw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"The concept is very simple.

The drinks are overpriced, but they are pretty good. I understand the 5 dollar fee per person to go into the cat room is for a good cause, but given the wait time and the short amount of time you actually get with the cats, I think it should be a bit lower. While I was there, about 20 people came and went. It would also be great if they updated their website more with better pictures of the adoptions that occur. I loved Storm, he was absolutely adorable - though admittedly mean to most people - but I never actually found out if he had been adopted after I left. I think if they updated their site more often, they might be even busier than they are now, though the experience is a bit underwhelming. And don't be surprised by the smell. 15+ cats have an odour, but it's no worse than that of 15+ people. It's normal, so that honestly should not even be an issue with people.","time":1513142546},{"author_name":"Vici Czestochowska","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109020916673099088187/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gvTTqNJgfwc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABg/xGvRKYz3yxc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Such a sweet place.

To go in the cafe is free and to go into the cat room you either have to pay 10$ straight or pay 5$ + a menu item (food and/or drink) -- I saw a few reviews complaining about this, but to me it's entirely reasonable. They're a private business and they wouldn't be able to sustain themselves otherwise -- plus, knowing how some people are, I imagine if it were free then a lot of customers might simply walk in only to see the cats and leave without supporting the business at all which wouldn't be too fair! I went on a weekday and they said it would be a 5-10 minute wait, but it ended up being a 3 minute wait\n\nThey do have rules when visiting the cats, but the rules are very fair. From what I remember, they were that [1] you have to take off your shoes in the cat room (they give you cute little cat slippers! And you can keep your shoes on in the cafe), [2] don't wake the sleeping cats (I saw someone complaining in a review about this is a bad rule, but? Waking a tired cat could stress or scare them and that isn't good for the cat -- you need to be considerate to the animals!), [3] you cannot pick the cats up as it could accidentally startle or hurt cats who are recovering from vet surgery (as these are rescued cats), [4] no flash photography but no-flash is okay. There was another rule I think, but I forget, oops!\n\nSince it was near the end of the day a lot of the cats were sleepy, but that makes sense after a long day of interacting with customers -- a lot of the kittens were very playful, though, so I got to interact with them a lot (they're so cute)! The large majority of the cats were very nice! One of the cats was a little stand off-ish, but that's very understandable as, like people, not all the cats are going to be in a social mood 100% of the time. There are plenty of other cats to interact with and sometimes a cat needs some private time to relax \n\nOverall, it was a very good experience for a rainy afternoon and I'm sure I'll be visiting again in the coming months!","time":1504846162},{"author_name":"Danielle Williams","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118051359404089432271/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OJxb6zmpLzA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/OsHyTekDf-E/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"I'm sure that it was an amazing place but unfortunately they were not getting enough business and they had to close down.
