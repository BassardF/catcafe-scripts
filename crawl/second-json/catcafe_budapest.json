Cats are all around you watching their job (sleeping) and some may join you when you eat. A little bit of a high prices but it is worth for only one visit. The service is outstanding as weel as their sandwiches.

Love the cats. They’re resting much of the time, as cats do during the day, so keep in mind they won’t be especially active. However, if patient, you’ll eventually interact with some.\nI’ve seen kids who don’t know better disturb and scare the cats. The cafe has implemented some new rules to try to manage this and other challenges that tend to happen in such an environment.\nI’m glad this place exists and hope it will be around for a long time.","time":1518214317},{"author_name":"Kristina Benkeova","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114026214287032376408/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SaVFMYEdkak/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAss/QkcoMmPpD_8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"It's fantastic place. :-) when you love cats (as we do) you will be in a little heaven. It's really beautiful cat cafe, the biggest we have ever seen. All the cats are very sweet and you can pet and cuddle with them. They will approach you when they feel like it. We tried coffee, hot chocolate, some lemonades, panini and cakes. Everything tasted very good. The staff was also kind. We had a really good time. :-)","time":1515189130},{"author_name":"Celia Pérez","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105764505191305229468/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zpFHDwBFUKM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGi4gfxxPtgXGGL8iHeHzcC7oG2lN7XHPw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I've been trying to go to a coffee shop like this one for a long time, but in many cities you need to book in advance. This cat cafe is like a normal place, you enter you ask for a table,order and enjoy the stay surrounded by different kind of cats. They are so cute and friendly, I loved the miaaawwall  with the description of them. Even the smell is nice. Apart from the kitties, the coffee and chocolate selection is great, not really overpriced.
