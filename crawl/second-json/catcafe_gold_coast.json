I took my daughter as she was missing our cat at home and it's been a highlight of our trip. The cats are placid, friendly and their personalities shine. They are very well looked after and the owner is very protective of them (rightly so). The thing that I noticed half way through is there's not a hint of cat smell. The Maine Coon, George, was our favourite. Very affordable but be sure to book online. Follow the basic rules, treat the cats with respect and you'll have a great time. \n\nThank you to the owner who gave my daughter a bit of extra time and a sweet when we left.
