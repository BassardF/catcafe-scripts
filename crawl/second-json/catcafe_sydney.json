It's really easy to get to by bus or from central. We've been to both the main room and the kitten room and enjoyed both, though I personally liked the kitten room more as they were super cute and very playful (went at 6:15pm). The older cats were a lot more chill and happy doing their own thing which wasn't as awesome, but still a cool experience. Staff are friendly and drink is nice. Overall a lovely visit and recommend for others.","time":1519482351},{"author_name":"Kumi Taguchi","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115293915485881773373/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MSZ3SGNW7K8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAANsM/arkhlRMgRHU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"We had a great time here and it was something fun and different to do with our daughter.
