Then, I was eager to visit to the Kitty Kingdom. The facility was clean, cute and ideally suited for young cats to play and explore.

Their cat-themed sweets are just too adorable. There's also lots of awesome cat-themed goods for sale from local vendors; pillows, t-shirts, pins, etc. If you're a cat person at all, it's great. \nThe cat space is really well done - lots of space for the cats to climb, hide, play, and just be cats. You can tell they really thought about the space when it was built, and it shows in that the cats really enjoy it. The cats are changed out every couple weeks, so you'll typically visit with some new ones each time you visit. All the cats are adoptable through the Meow foundation (which is an amazing organization) so when new cats come in, it's because the previous ones went to new homes.","time":1517446194},{"author_name":"Chelsea C","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102052773031494290817/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8WvZMMXmLpM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEs/aQB5Kp5dEw0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I really love that this place exists. So many kitties get to find their furever homes here. The kitty kingdom area is amazing for them to run around and play. A great “home away from home.” I do think the admission price is a bit steep...I know people will continue to pay it though...however the owners should really take into consideration the amount of people voicing their concerns on the pricing. I would feel better about the $10 per person admission if half the cost went directly to the meow foundation.
