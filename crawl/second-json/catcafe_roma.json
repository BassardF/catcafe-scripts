The service was amazing, we arrived early for our lunch reservation and were able to have a drink until our table was ready. The coconut, mango and vanilla smoothie was delicious. The cats were gorgeous, the decor was delightful. The cats were able to be out of humans reach and sight if they wanted, just climb up the tree or hide in a draw on the wall, or sunbathe in the windows and let you stroke them. They were so chilled and relaxed and the ginger one had a beautiful meow.  The place was empty when we arrived but quickly became full, so definitely make a reservation so you are not disappointed. The food was flavoursome with generous portions. The tap water was a big plus for me, bottled water is not necessary. Highly recommend this vegan restaurant :-)","time":1517090968},{"author_name":"Kasia Słupecka","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115075530251387352167/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-z5yLsA0PTvg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAcbw/_n-PxIta614/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Lovely atmosphere and food. And of course cats are super cute and everyone pays attention to them when they walk around.\nI picked lunch option with dessert. The taste was good but dessert was just blowing my mind. I picked white cheesiness cheesecake with fruits. Yummy. \nService was super nice!\nThe place is nicely decorated, I really appreciated how everything was designed to also fit the needs of cats to walk around. \nOverall the atmosphere is sweet thanks to the look and it's complimented by ordinal dishes and cute cats. All that I need to be satisfied with my stay.","time":1514541684},{"author_name":"Evro Top Tour","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107245013814545688963/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DMtM1QukCHE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHc/YbSnH7-lxt0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"It is an amazing place.

So I decided to just stop by for lunch the next day and the hostess refused to seat me. The restaurant was empty, but she claimed that it was booked. I was so shocked, I had no idea how to respond and just left. It is apparent that the employees at Romeow are racist against Americans. I guess they don't want my business. I will never recommend this place after I was treated so horribly. I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. I hope they treat the cats better than they treat their customers.","time":1516215157},{"author_name":"Jack Wignall","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107688722134442144833/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9-1eBr6pvYY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACpI/4Iih3iPXiRA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Brilliant 5* service, fun place to be in.
