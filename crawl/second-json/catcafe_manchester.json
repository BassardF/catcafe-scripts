There are so many different types of beautiful friendly cats, perfect for a relaxing afternoon. As all drinks are included in the entrance price I had a cappuccino and then an elderflower lemonade, both of which were lovely. I also treated myself and my mum to a slice of their salter caramel chocolate cake which was delicious! The only negative comment that I have is that there were a few too many teenage girls who were just there to take selfies with the cats. So when a cat walked over to me and my mum a few teenagers followed it and crowded it. The staff were very good at making sure people didn’t pick up the cats etc but some of the customers did ruin it a little with the lack of space they gave the animals.","time":1519204282},{"author_name":"Michael Davies","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108136807870168918210/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zyzRtZS10ho/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGi4gfwJV7evDlIUynxJhtg2gWSihdlt7Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"To my surprise, the cats comfort was paramount. With a private escape room, cats interact with customers on their own volition; strict rules on customers behavior are placed to ensure the cats private tendencies are respected throughout. Pedigree bred, cats are specifically selected for their sociability. Working alongside cat rescue charities, a wall is dedicated to finding homes for those needing adoption. A menu - offering unlimited hot/cold drinks with admission fee - catering for all dietary requirements was welcome. However, the admission fee of £1 per person for every 5 minutes stayed quickly escalated into expensive territory. And a single toilet unfortunately created a queue in a narrow corridor. Overall an impressive cat-first, relaxed experience suffering only minor issues.","time":1519114373},{"author_name":"Molly Colyer","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104697119150298168041/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--pSfmkfCbLE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAOj8/61x6uQLEFjA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"So much better than I was expecting.

The cats seem very well treated and looked after. Some truly stunning breeds. Very friendly staff who can't wait to tell you all about each cat if asked. It's a bit on the pricey side in my opinion but why not charge that much when people are literally waiting to get in. I'd advise booking ahead of time and also aiming for early slots weekdays 10-11 or 11-12 as the cats will be most active and it won't have gotten as busy as it can. I will say once it gets busy it does feel like the cats get a bit swamped but they can always disappear to put of reach places or their own private area.","time":1517435859},{"author_name":"Cameron Cook","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113052024653908717777/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oMvCmFpaLis/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAByA/8Kal_cmZqlM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Very good value for money really!
