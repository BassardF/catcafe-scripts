We have to pay ($12) for the entry which is a bit too pricey to just see just only cats (ex. Melbourne zoo entry fee $18).\n\n2. The place looks ok but not look amazing as we expected.\n\n3. The coffee price is acceptable ($3) per cup but the taste should be improved.\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. It might be good for you to concern about entry fee (ex. $10 for entry and free one coffee or 1 drink), \n\n2. better decorated such as wall painting and cat accessories.\n\n3. Better coffee taste.\n\nIf it pricey, people might come just only once and won’t come back again.\n\nIt would be better that the price is ok. People get in drink good coffee, listen nice music, play with cat and feel relaxed with beautiful environment.\n\nHope this can help you to improve your cafe for long term.","time":1517383221}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["cafe","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=4532882955962622216","utc_offset":660,"vicinity":"30 Guildford Lane, Melbourne","website":"http://www.catcafemelbourne.com/"},"status":"OK"}}]
