Can’t get enough of the kitties. Plus as some are usually sleeping/hiding, it’s likely you’ll see different cats each visit. Drinks are good and staff is great. Prices are frankly reasonable, keeping in mind they have to buy food, litter etc. for so many cats! Cakes are genuinely delicious as well. \n\nI don’t get people who are disappointed because they expect the cats to be interested in them specifically. They see dozens of people a day who are all trying to get their attention. I’m thankful even to see them sleep.
