They have 2 rooms. One where there are all the cats, the other where there are tables and u can have your tea  and snacks and watch the cats in the next room through the glass. They serve Japanese tea which is good. I ended up not eating as I was busy with the cats! You can spend an hour with the cats. They are the cutest little things. You can pet them and play with them. Some are up for adoption too. Although most of them maybe sleeping when you get in.. but the smart little creatures will wake when it's feeding time. You get to feed them as well. They are so disciplined when they eat! Overall it was an amazing experience. We will be looking to come here once again.","time":1519229062},{"author_name":"Daniel Cheng","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111204115437793165211/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ORnFOilL9Ng/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACc/EnAy95kBVoc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Great place. A little on the pricey side and definitely need to make reservations but I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and it was a lot of fun. I'm allergic to cats but because they keep the place really clean, my allergies didn't start to kick in until close to the end of our reserved hour. They had 15 cats in total for about 12 of us so there was a pretty good ratio of cat:hooman even with a few cats resting in the back. Overall a great experience and the owners really treat the cats well.","time":1520719188},{"author_name":"Marc Twomey","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112303798146576473824/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BSpSMH3uQzI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABw/Rso0m_xgOm8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"The cafe was nice and loved the glass window that you could look into the cat area and see all the sleeping cats even though they were friendly but pretty much just slept. The coffee and tea was pretty good but the scone was way over priced. Also, make sure to check your spoons, the one I received was dirty and the cat milk container I was given for my drink had some black thing in it. \n\nOverall, I would go back but not anytime soon. With the small space you have, I think the employees should keep personal property in the back it took up two seats at the small counter space and she never even sat down, just came by to look at something on her laptop. Love the concept, might want to consider using kittens as they would be more playful. I appreciate you using rescue cats though!\n\nFor 15-20 dollars per person, some people never even got to pet a cat as the cats were either sleeping or other people had other cats attention. One couple looked totally miserable.","time":1515139160},{"author_name":"Amanda Fudge","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116592807378075731390/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UpQKLrmZOWE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGi4gfyKhG6nZOTr7SYfTyCcEzaxFxEV-Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"The tea was really good the cats, were all right the cat Wrangler, was a wealth of knowledge and enjoyable to speak with.
